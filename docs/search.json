This course introduces natural language processing (NLP) and text as data, focusing on practical applications and problem-solving. Using Python, the class covers fundamental NLP techniques, including text preprocessing, text classification, topic modeling, text embeddings, benchmarking and evaluation, transfer learning, and large language models (including generative LLMs). Applications involve working with data such as product reviews, tweets and other social media posts, news articles, and open-ended surveys to answer questions in domains like the social sciences and business.\nTextbook: You will not need to purchase any textbooks. The books can be accessed online, through the University Library, or through Canvas. Readings may also come from other online sources. One of the tricky aspects of this class is that the field continues to evolve as the class goes on. Textbooks written even a few years ago may be out of date! Please have the readings completed before class. It is okay if you do not understand everything in the assigned reading.\n\n[SLP] Speech and Language Processing. Dan Jurafsky and James H.
